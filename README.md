# Scheduler Microservice

This project involves developing a **Scheduler Microservice** to manage job scheduling and related information. The microservice will expose API endpoints to **create**, **list**, and **retrieve** job details.

The service will handle dummy jobs (e.g., email notifications or number crunching) and maintain job-related data, while the actual job execution logic is outside the scope.
